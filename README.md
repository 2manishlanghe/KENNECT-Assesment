Time complexity of isPrime function is O(sqrt(n)) because it iterates up to the square root of the given number.
Space complexity of isPrime function is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space for variables.
Time taken to run all instances of getPrimeInRange depends on the range of input provided.
Time taken to determine if a single number is prime or not in front of each number checked is O(sqrt(n)).
Time taken to determine if the number is prime or not in front of each number found prime is O(1).
Average of time taken for steps 2.b and 2.c depends on the range of input provided and the number of prime numbers found.
